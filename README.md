# Java Interview Questions for Top Tech Companies

## Introduction

This repository contains a collection of interview questions commonly asked by top tech companies in JavaScript-related roles. However, I have transformed these JavaScript questions into their Java implementation. The goal is to help job seekers prepare for technical interviews and land high-paying jobs without a degree. Additionally, this resource can assist college students whose universities use Java for their courses.
